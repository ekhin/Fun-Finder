Application Concept:
    Our application helps people to plan for their vacation by searching activities they can do based on location (city, state), such as amusement park, art gallery, museum, park, and zoo.  
    Once the users find the place they want to visit, they can add them to their to-do list and save their itinerary by signing into their accounts.

Motivation: 
    Allow users to setup to-do list based on number of days they are visiting.
    Using Google Maps markers, users can see and select which places they want to visit and add them to their to-do list to create an itinerary for their vacation.
    Having users to sign into their accounts will allow them to save their to-do lists and come back to their lists later.  They can check off their list items after they complete.

End Results:
    Users will have an itinerary for their vacation with a to-do checklist.
    Store users' itinerary in Firebase database for repeated access and update their list.

Future Developments:
    Mobile Responsive, 
    Add Weather API,
    Add “Restaurants” or more options under Venue drop-down list,
    Add “forgot password” and “Logout” button.
